# Student Mental Health Risk Screening Tool

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a predictive machine learning system to identify at-risk students for proactive mental health support, addressing the critical treatment gap where only 21.4% of high-risk students seek help voluntarily.

## 📊 Dataset Used

**Student Mental Health Dataset** from Kaggle  
🔗 [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health)

- **101 students** with comprehensive mental health and academic data
- **11 features** including demographics, academic performance, and mental health indicators
- **Mental health conditions**: Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks
- **Treatment-seeking behavior** tracking

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Deployment**: Custom screening dashboard with batch processing

## 📈 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Cleaned and standardized 11 raw features from student surveys
- Created composite **Mental Health Score** (0-3 scale) from depression, anxiety, and panic attack indicators
- Engineered **Risk Categories** (Low/Medium/High) for targeted interventions
- One-hot encoded categorical variables for machine learning compatibility

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identified critical patterns in mental health prevalence across demographics
- Analyzed treatment-seeking behaviors and gaps
- Discovered relationships between academic pressure and mental health

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Built and compared multiple classification algorithms
- **Binary classification**: High-risk vs Not high-risk students
- **Multi-class classification**: Low/Medium/High risk categories
- Optimized for **sensitivity** to minimize missed at-risk cases

### 4. Model Deployment
- Developed interactive screening dashboard for counseling services
- Implemented batch processing for entire student cohorts
- Created priority-based intervention protocols
- Built export functionality for case management systems

## 📊 Results & Key Findings

### 🎯 Critical Treatment Gap Discovery
- **27.7%** of students identified as high-risk
- Only **21.4%** of high-risk students seek treatment voluntarily
- **78.6% treatment gap** highlighting need for proactive screening

### 🏆 Best Model Performance
**Random Forest Classifier** achieved:
- **Accuracy**: 87.3%
- **F1-Score**: 85.1%
- **Sensitivity**: 82.6% (critical for minimizing missed cases)
- **AUC-ROC**: 92.4%

### 🔍 Key Risk Factors Identified

**Top Predictive Features:**
1. **Academic Program** (Engineering/Medicine highest risk)
2. **Year of Study** (Upper years show increased risk)
3. **CGPA** (High achievers at elevated anxiety risk)
4. **Gender** (Female students show higher depression rates)
5. **Age Group** (21-23 age range most vulnerable)

### 📈 Demographic Insights
- **Depression**: Most common condition (34.7% prevalence)
- **Gender Difference**: Female students 38.7% vs Male 23.1% depression rates
- **Academic Pressure**: 36.3% anxiety rate among high CGPA students
- **Program Variation**: Engineering and Medicine students show highest risk levels

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Quick Start
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Run in Google Colab (Recommended):

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
# Run the provided Jupyter notebook cells sequentially
```
3. Local Execution:

```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open and run: Mental_Health_Screener.ipynb
```

## Step-by-Step Execution

1. Step 1: Data Loading & Initial Exploration
2. Step 2: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
3. Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
4. Step 4: Model Training & Evaluation
5. Step 5: Deployment & Screening Dashboard

Using the Screening Tool
```python
# Screen individual students
student_data = {
    'gender': 'Female',
    'age': 21,
    'course': 'Engineering',
    'year_of_study': 'Year 3',
    'cgpa': '3.50-4.00',
    'marital_status': 'Single'
}

prediction, probability = screener.predict_risk(student_data)
print(f"Risk Level: {risk_level}, Probability: {probability:.1%}")
```

## Batch Processing
```python
# Screen multiple students
results = batch_screen_students(student_list)
export_screening_results(results, 'screening_results.csv')
```

#💡 Business Impact
